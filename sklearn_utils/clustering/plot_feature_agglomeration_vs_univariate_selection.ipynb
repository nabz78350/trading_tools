        "\n",
        "#### Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature selection is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline, where the goal is to select the most relevant features for building a predictive model. Here, we use the ANOVA F-test to select features based on their relationship with the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Math Behind ANOVA F-Test\n",
        "\n",
        "- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: This statistical method assesses whether the means of different groups are significantly different from each other.\n",
        "- **F-Test**: In this context, the F-test compares the variance between the groups (explained variance) to the variance within the groups (unexplained variance).\n",
        "\n",
        "The F-value is calculated as:\n",
        "$\\ F = \\frac{\\text{variance between groups}}{\\text{variance within groups}} $\n",
        "\n",
        "For each feature:\n",
        "$\\ F_j = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} n_k (\\bar{x}_{k,j} - \\bar{x}_j)^2}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_k} (x_{i,j} - \\bar{x}_{k,j})^2} $\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "- $\\ K $ is the number of groups.\n",
        "- $\\ n_k $ is the number of samples in group $\\ k $.\n",
        "- $\\ \\bar{x}_{k,j} $ is the mean of feature $\\ j $ in group $\\ k $.\n",
        "- $\\ \\bar{x}_j $ is the overall mean of feature $\\ j $.\n",
        "- $\\ x_{i,j} $ is the value of feature $\\ j $ for sample $\\ i $.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Intuition\n",
        "\n",
        "The intuition behind using the ANOVA F-test for feature selection is to determine which features have the strongest linear relationship with the target variable. Features with higher F-values are considered more important because they explain a larger proportion of the variance in the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### How It Selects Features\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Calculation of F-values**: For each feature, the F-value is computed as described above.\n",
        "- **Ranking**: Features are ranked based on their F-values.\n",
        "- **Selection**: A specified percentage of features with the highest F-values are selected. Features not selected are effectively reduced in importance, often set to zero or ignored in further modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Main Arguments\n",
        "\n",
        "- `score_func`: The scoring function used to evaluate the features. For ANOVA F-test, this is typically `feature_selection.f_regression`. It calculates the F-statistic for each feature based on a simple linear regression model.\n",
        "- `percentile`: The percentage of top features to retain. For example, if `percentile=10`, only the top 10% of features based on their F-values will be selected.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Advantages\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Simplicity**: The ANOVA F-test is easy to compute and understand.\n",
        "- **Efficiency**: It is computationally efficient, making it suitable for high-dimensional data.\n",
        "- **Relevance**: By selecting features based on their statistical significance, we can improve the performance of the model by focusing on the most informative features.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Disadvantages\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Univariate**: ANOVA F-test considers each feature independently, ignoring potential interactions between features.\n",
        "- **Linear Assumption**: Assumes a linear relationship between each feature and the target variable, which may not always hold true in practice.\n"
